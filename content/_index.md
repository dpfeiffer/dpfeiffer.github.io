Building the future of recruiting at firstbird. Loving Scala, Akka, Functional Programming and speaking about it.

I enjoy working with our encouraged team here at Firstbird, delivering not just a product, but a whole experience for our customers. I am a product loving developer, putting my head down and try to make it even better.

I try to share my knowledge giving talks at Usergroups, contribute to Open Source projects I use privately and at work, and write about things I discover during my work.
