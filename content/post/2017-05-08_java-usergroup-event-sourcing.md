description: Here you can find a summary of my talk about "Event Sourcing using Akka on AWS" at the Java User Group in Vienna, as well as the presentation.
---

This talk is about our experiences at Firstbird using the Akka toolkit building a modern, event sourced software architecture on Amazon Web Services. In modern software architectures, which are going to be deployed on the cloud there are various moving parts which have to be glued together to build an overall architecture out of them. AWS provides some very basic but yet powerful tools like the Simple Queue Service and the Simple Notification Service which enable developers to build a scalable event driven architecture.

I already gave this talk at the Scala User Group in 2016 so it is not completely new but adapted for Java Developers. All examples are translated to Playframework Java and the overall design is aligned with standard Java 8 practices.

The code samples can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dpfeiffer/event-sourcing-aws-akka-showcase-java).
