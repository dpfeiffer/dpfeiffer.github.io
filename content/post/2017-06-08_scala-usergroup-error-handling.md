Scala is a very unopinionated programming language so there are many ways of solving certain problems. One problem I always had when writing business software was the handling of errors. In Java we are used to throw exceptions to model failure behaviour which makes applications usually hard to understand. Gladly there are better alternatives using Scala and the cats library which I presented to the Viennese Scala Community.
