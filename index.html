		Hello, my name is Daniel and I am a software developer. I am developing software for 10 years now, mostly on web application backends. Also studying Business Informatics at Vienna University of Technology. My focus as a developer is to write high quality code which made me a fan of functional programming paradigms which I try to apply as much as possible in my main working environment even I work mainly on Java projects. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact me on my social media profiles.

		<h2>Java</h2>
		I am working with Java for nearly 10 years with a main focus on web application backends but some frontend applications crossed my way too. During that time I made expierences with quite a lot of technologies like JSF, JPA, EJBs, Spring, VAADIN, Swing.

		<h2>Scala</h2>
		Since a while I am working with the Scala language on a couple of side and work projects. In my opinion functional programming will lead us towards better understandable code I try to adopt as many ideas as possible. While learning Scala I learned a lot about managing concurrency and state with AKKA.
